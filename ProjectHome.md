Athena Framework is a full fledged enterprise object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that employs metadata as mapping configuration. It greatly simplifies Java web application development by removing the requirement of manual mapping and manual database schema updating.

In addition to features like Java object persistence, powerful EJBQL querying execution and comprehensive code generation, Athena has built-in support for multi-tenancy which enables developers to build cloud applications easily. Athena can be easily integrated with other libraries like Struts or Spring to provide full stacks of service.

## Athena Framework for Flex ##

Athena Framework is a full fledged enterprise object-relational mapping (ORM) framework that employs metadata as mapping configuration. It greatly simplifies Flex/Flash RIA application development by providing transparent object remoting - i.e., you can manipulate objects on the client side using Flex just like on the server side using ActionScript thanks to the unified object model provided by Athena.

Further more, Athena Framework removes the requirement of manual ORM mapping and manual database schema updating. In addition to features like object relational persistence, powerful EJBQL querying execution and comprehensive code generation, Athena has built-in support for multi-tenancy which enables developers to build cloud applications easily.
